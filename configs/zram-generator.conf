# ZRAM Generator Configuration
# Place this file in /etc/systemd/zram-generator.conf
# Provides compressed RAM for better performance

[zram0]
# Size of ZRAM device
# Use 50% of RAM for ZRAM (compression typically gives 2-3x)
zram-size = ram / 2

# Compression algorithm
# lz4 = fastest, zstd = better compression
compression-algorithm = zstd

# Swap priority
swap-priority = 100

# Filesystem for ZRAM (if not using as swap)
# fs-type = ext4

# Memory limit
# mem-limit = 4096
